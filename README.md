## Objective
The goal of this project is to use a synthetic control approach to evaluate the impact of electric utility company liability on wildfire risk.

## Research Question
Did a 1999 California Supreme Court Ruling on electric utility company liability played a role in fire management in California?

## Importance
Wildfires are becoming worse and more frequent every year as a result of global warming especially during the summer months in California.
+ Direct damage: Property damage & fire suppression costs.
+ Indirect damage: Lost tax revenue, negative health effects from smoke & carbon emissions.

## Discussion & Policy Implications
+ Insignificant results with and without controls in the graphs, placebo tests and MSPE values.
+ Opens the door to future research opportunities.
+ Alcohol consumption isnâ€™t a gateway to hard drug use.
+ Wildfires are an inevitable reality!
+ Policy wise more stringent measures need to be taken to hold those who cause them accountable to preserve the environment and decrease the cost it imposes on society.
